      question: "Why is it important to renew my domain every year?",
      answer:
        "Renewing your domain ensures that your online store or website remains active and accessible to customers. If your domain expires, your site can go offline, lose search visibility, and even risk being purchased by someone else. Regular renewal guarantees continuous ownership and uptime.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I forget to renew my domain on time?",
      answer:
        "If a domain isn’t renewed before the expiration date, it typically enters a grace period. During this time, your website may go offline, and email or connected services could stop working. After the grace period, the domain may become publicly available again. Hostly.io prevents this by sending reminders and offering automatic renewals.",
    },
    {

    {
      question: "Can I renew my domain for more than one year?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. You can extend your domain registration for multiple years in advance. This helps you secure your domain for the long term and avoid yearly renewals while maintaining full ownership and protection.",
    },
